        <h2>Why is this site made?</h2>
        <p>There are multiple reasons, but to name a few</p>
        <ul>
          <li>I'd found it should be easier to get feedback on your setup, so that when you are ready to upgrade you can get the right new item!</li>
          <li>I wanted to learn Vue.js a Javascript frame work and this is my first real world project!</li>
          <li>Doesn't it look awesome? Why would you even question awesome things like this!</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Why can I only select decks, tucks and wheels? Where are my brackets, split duros!</h2>
        <p>
          Because getting the content for only these parts was a nightmare. I've contacted several vendors and brands, but only a few responded to my messages. This mean I needed to gather all the products by hand. Over the past half year I've imported 2000+ products, but this is far from a complete set. If you want to help
          <nuxt-link to="/submit">be sure to submit a product</nuxt-link>.
          Or if you are a vendor and want to bulk import your product,
          <nuxt-link to="/submit">be sure to let me know</nuxt-link>.
